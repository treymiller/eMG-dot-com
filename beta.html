<p>We&#39;re currently in Private Beta, which means our features are changing every day. Hopefully for the better, and always based on your feedback and our ultimate goals for the service. Here are some guidelines of what you can expect and what we&#39;re asking of you:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We strive to have a stable, reliable service that&#39;s available 24/7. However, during Private Beta, you should be prepared for occasional email delivery delays of up to an hour. We may also take down the web interface for up to 5 minutes at a time, and we&#39;ll try to limit this downtime to 11pm-7am ET.</p>
</li>
<li><p>While we&#39;re all building confidence in the reliability of the system, we&#39;re going to send you a confirmation email with a Subject Line that begins &quot;Delivered:&quot; every time you send to your group address. We realize this may be over-communicating, but we feel you&#39;d rather have the confirmation than wonder if our system is working from one hour to the next. Pending your feedback, we will either remove this feature entirely in the future, or make it an option you can toggle on/off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We&#39;re logging diagnostic information right now, so that we can learn as much as possible about how people use our service and how we can improve it. For example, if you send a link in an email to our group, the link in your email will get wrapped in our logging service so that we can see how many people are clicking links in your emails. This is something we&#39;ll turn off when we come out of Beta. NOTE: our <a href="http://emailgrouper.com/terms">Terms</a> and <a href="http://emailgrouper.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> will always apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known Issues and Bugs</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>When adding Member(s) using the To: field or Subject Line Commands in an email, the confirmation email may not include the new Member(s) address(es) in it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attachments: we are not passing attachments through our system at this time. If you send an email with a file (.PDF, .DOC, photo, etc.) attached, the email will be delivered but the attachment will be stripped out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Null&quot; or &quot;Undefined&quot; in the Body Field of an email: In rare instances, your email may be delivered to your Group Members but the body content may be replaced with the word &quot;Null&quot; or &quot;Undefined&quot;. You will still receive a &quot;Delivered&quot; email from us in this instance, so unfortunately the only way you&#39;ll know that this happened is if one of your Members replies asking why you sent this strange message. If you experience this bug, please report it to support@emailgrouper.com.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Unexpected Behaviors</h2>
<p>We strive to make every email sent through eMailGrouper behave the same way any other email would. However, due to the features we&#39;re offering beyond what normal email can do, there are occasional conflicts. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you send an email with a Group Address in the To: field, and other addresses in the CC: field, your To: recipients will not see those CC: addresses in the email they receive. (This is because if we added the CC: addresses when we parse the email out to your Members, the CC: recipients would get a second copy of the email.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Where a solution is technically feasible, we are working hard to implement that solution as quickly as possible. In some cases, there are unresolvable conflicts, though.</p>
