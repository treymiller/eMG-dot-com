          ## Privacy Policy
          ####Does anyone at your company read my emails?

          No. Our servers process email but we do not store or log body content. During Private Beta, we are logging and processing anonymous header information for troubleshooting and performance-tuning.

          #### Are my email addresses shared/sold?

          No. We don't sell or share any data with third parties.

          #### Will you turn over my information to the government?

          Maybe. We are bound by the law of the land, and if we're lawfully compelled to turn over data we will abide by the law. Remember, though, we don't store your email content, so what we could be compelled to turn over should be of no value to the authorities.

          #### Are you going to send me spam?

          No. What's more, we won't even send you information on behalf of any third party. We will send you periodic updates concerning our service, but we won't bug you constantly. We promise.
