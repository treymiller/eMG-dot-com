          ## What Private Beta Means
          We're currently in Private Beta, which means our features are changing every day. Hopefully for the better, and always based on your feedback and our ultimate goals for the service. Here are some guidelines of what you can expect and what we're asking of you:

          1. We strive to have a stable, reliable service that's available 24/7. However, during Private Beta, you should be prepared for occasional email delivery delays of up to 5 minutes. We may also take down the web interface for up to 5 minutes at a time, and we'll try to limit this downtime to 11pm-7am ET.

          1. Item #2.
